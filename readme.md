## About

__Refinery's news engine allows you to post updates to the news section of your website.__

Key features:

* Default news page shows a summary of recent news posts
* Detail view shows the full post and also linked to recent news on the "side bar"

## Requirements

[Refinery CMS](http://refinerycms.com) "core" engine version 2.0.0 or later.

### Gem Installation using Bundler (The very best way)

Include the latest [gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/refinerycms-news) into your Refinery CMS application's Gemfile:

    gem "refinerycms-news", '~> 2.0.0'

Then type the following at command line inside your Refinery CMS application's root directory:

    bundle install
    rails generate refinery:news
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

## Configuring the number of items per page

To modify the number of items per page for the news items index without
affecting the archive page you must override the method in the controller that
sets `@items` for the index: `find_published_news_items`.

Currently the method body is:
```ruby
@items = Item.published.translated.page(params[:page])
```

The `page` convenience method needs to be replaced with `paginate` and
`per_page` passed as an option.  Add a decorator for the items controller with
the following contents:

```ruby
module Refinery::News
  ItemsController.class_eval do
    def find_published_news_items
      @items = Item.published.translated.paginate :page => params[:page],
                                                  :per_page => 8
    end
  end
end
```

## Customising the views

Type this command at your project root to override the default front end views:

    $ rake refinery:override view=refinery/news/items/*
    Copied view template file to app/views/refinery/news/items/_recent_posts.html.erb
    Copied view template file to app/views/refinery/news/items/index.html.erb
    Copied view template file to app/views/refinery/news/items/show.html.erb
    etc.

## RSS (Really Simple Syndication)

To get RSS for your entire site, insert this into the head section of your layout after installing:

```erb
<%= auto_discovery_link_tag(:rss, refinery.news_items_url(:format => 'rss')) %>
```
